     <h3>My First Day in Horsens</h3>
     <p>
         Two years ago &quot;Erasmus&quot; 
         sounded strange for me. I have never thought I would leave Spain to do part of 
         my studies. But one, I decided to apply for Erasmus program.</p>
     <p>
         My first option was Eindhoven but there I could not do my final project so the Spanish 
         coordinators suggested an opportunity for Horsens and finally I accepted and 
         now, I am here!</p>
     <p>
         The first day in Horsens was 
         the worst day I have ever had for the last couple of years, because we arrived 
         to the Billund airport on Sunday and we didn`t know how could we go to Horsens. 
         First we took the bus to Horsens, which stopped near a gas station. There we 
         waited for another bus for almost three hours, afterwards when we finally 
         arrived to the Via University we met the person responsible of our 
         accommodation. We spoke with him and he left. Then again we had to wait another 
         two hours. We thought that nobody will come to pick us up, but finally we got 
         our room and the nightmare was finally over.&nbsp;
         
     </p>
     <p>
         That night we were very tired 
         because of the long journey, but we saw a lot people in the residence listening 
         to music and talking to each other, so we joined them in the yard of “Kamjatka”, 
         started making friends and having fun.
     </p>

         Since the day I arrived here 
         everything changed. Your life here will be different; here you meet a lot of 
         interesting people from different countries, with different cultures, different 
         habits, and especially with happiness and
         wanting to party.</p>
     <p>
         
         Living in a residence 
         like Kamtjatka in the best; you don’t need to make plans; plans are made. You 
         only should go downstairs and there will be people talking and having fun.</p>
     <p>
         
         I don’t know your 
         university, but this university is much better than mine; teachers are very 
         nice, facilities are very modern; and there are a lot of people everywhere.</p>
     <p>
         The only bad thing is 
         the weather; I’m from Spain and I’m used to sunny weather but here is always 
         raining and it isn’t very pleasant going by bicycle when it’s raining
