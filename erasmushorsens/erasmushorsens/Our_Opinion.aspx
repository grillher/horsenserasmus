         <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">Two years ago &quot;Erasmus&quot; 
         sounded strange for me. I have never thought I would leave Spain to do part of 
         my studies. But one, I decided to apply for Erasmus program.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

         coordinators suggested an opportunity for Horsens and finally I accepted and 
         now, I am here!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
     <p class="MsoNormal">
         <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">The first day in Horsens was 
         the worst day I have ever had for the last couple of years, because we arrived 
         to the Billund airport on Sunday and we didn`t know how could we go to Horsens. 
         First we took the bus to Horsens, which stopped near a gas station. There we 
         waited for another bus for almost three hours, afterwards when we finally 
         arrived to the Via University we met the person responsible of our 
         accommodation. We spoke with him and he left. Then again we had to wait another 
         two hours. We thought that nobody will come to pick us up, but finally we got 
         our room and the nightmare was finally over.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

         <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">That night we were very tired 
         because of the long journey, but we saw a lot people in the residence listening 
         to music and talking to each other, so we joined them in the yard of “Kamjatka”, 
         started making friends and having fun.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;

         interesting people from different countries, with different cultures, different
