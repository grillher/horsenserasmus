        The mediaval city center with its many historic buildings and snug pedestrian 
        lanes is the backdrop to an exciting shopping experience with many speciality 
        stores, department stores, and the downtown Bytorv Horsens shopping centre.</p>
    <p>
        The city teams with life and creativity when musicians, singers, performers, and 
        actors fill the streets during the annual Street Theatre Festival. Comfortable 
        cafés and restaurants offer a welcome breather, refreshments, or a good meal.</p>
    <p>
        In December the Christmas Village sets up stalls with decorations, tradicional 
        elves, and scrumptions treats. Song, music, and theatre fill the stage in the 
        square, and Father Christmas invites you for a sleigh ride through the 
        beautifully decorated streets.</p>
    <p>
        As for supermarkets, there are several options between we emphasize:</p>
    <p>
        - Netto, the cheapest one but it doesn&#39;t have many products.</p>
    <p>
        - Bilka, the biggest one and it has a lot of procucts and offers.</p>
    <p>
        - Lojvers, there is one Lojvers in the main square, but it&#39;s a bit more 
        expensive.</p>
    <p>
        - Fakta, there the meat is cheaper and it&#39;s the best option if you live in the 
        Student Village.</p>
